If you are a part of a neighborhood association, a member of a “Next Door” Community, or receive neighborhood updates through email or print newsletters, please help us to reach out to your neighbors about coyotes in your neighborhoods and local parks. Share the information below in whatever way is preferred, and contact Dianne Robinson (Dianne.robinson@wisconsin.gov) or Julia Robson (Julia.robson@milwaukeecountywi.gov) with questions. \r\n\r\n\"Coyotes sightings in and near our neighborhoods in Milwaukee County are quite common and are rarely a cause for concern. However, Milwaukee County Parks and the Wisconsin DNR are interested in this information to monitor coyote activity and coyote behavior. If you see a coyote, please report this observation to the “Milwaukee County Coyote Watch” project page at iNaturalist.org (http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/milwaukee-county-coyote-watch). If you know coyotes are present in your area, it is always important to keep a close eye on your pet when outside, regardless of their size, and be sure to inform your neighbors to not feed urban wildlife in their yards or local parks. If you have questions, visit the DNR’s Urban Coyote webpage (http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/wildlifehabitat/urbancoyote.html) or our Urban Wildlife webpage (http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/wildlifehabitat/urban.html) for more information.
